# PhysicsTestingRepo
Experimenting with Physics Simulations and building realistic simulations for video games, studies and the matter.


This is a personal repository for my experimentation with physics simulations. I am taking most of my code inspiration from various sources, but following along with what I have learned and the process of the matter, I will actively add to this repository as I further my physics simulation knowledge.

First Project:
Realistic Newtons Cradle 
Start Date: 11/30/24
